# How do media representations inform our thinking about the world?

The media loves to show stereotypes of minority groups. When [I reflected on our seminar](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16o6BIDwrSKPwbvNOQgAlNgpL5YVe3RZXAyEocxjQaeE/edit?tab=t.0) for _Master of None_, I noted that
> people might not make the morally right decision in the face of discrimination, but instead not do anything in hopes that they will get an opportunity they would miss if they report the discrimination.

The seminar taught me that people might try to act like a stereotype to fit in, even if the stereotype is really harmful. It taught me that media representations inform our thinking about the world by making choices in representing certain groups that affects people's perception of that group.
